# EXCERCISE: ELABORATE TIMES TABLES

My son's teacher gave him an assignment. Practice the division table. We parents had to check his progress but in doing so we had to check it out of order. So I took it as a challenge in my learning. I didn't do much but here it is.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned
The interesting thing is that I learned that I should not stop practicing since much knowledge can easily fall into oblivion.
Record√© algunos conceptos de grid, math operations.

### Continued development

I would like practice more projects with grid applications.
